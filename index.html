                <h3>Meta Gallery - Filesystem-based gallery engine</h3>
                <p>Since I have accumulated a lot of photos in the last few years, I was really in a need for a fast, easily searchable, no-nonsense, straightforward online image gallery without all the bells and whistles. Since I couldn't find any, I have decided to make one on my own, specifically tailored for all my needs.</p>
                <p>Meta Gallery is a minimalistic and fast gallery based on htmx, Tailwind, vanilla PHP, filesystem and IPTC Photo Metadata. Doesn't require a database.</p>

                <h3>An e-commerce/CMS engine</h3>
                <p>A custom CodeIgniter-based CMS/e-commerce solution which I have started to build in 2006, and it's the base of a couple of webshops, most notably <a href="https://en.officeshoes.hu/" title="OfficeShoes">Officeshoes</a>, <a href="https://legend.rs" title="Legend">Legend</a> and <a href="https://pokloni.com" title="Pokloni">Pokloni</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    I have stopped working on it years ago, but the engine is maintained and updated to this date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The features I've had the main focus on while creating the engine were: multisites/multilanguage (ability to serve unlimited number of domains from the same base engine), versatile/dynamic filtering, high level of search engine optimization, and a robust but flexible administration area.

                <h3>Destination - Locator of interesting and/or exotic places</h3>
                <p>A hobby project I am working on whenever I find a bit of time.</p>
                <p>I decided to create this project when I moved to Szeged and had a hard time to find interesting places to visit/check out other than the usual tourist spots. Whenever I've made a lot of bicycle trips around the city I collected intriguing destinations around my city not just for myself, but to share with others as well. Thus, a database of those places grew, and an UI for it was needed, so Destination.hu was born.</p>
                <p>At the moment, the project is still <strong>in its alpha/MVP phase with a lot of proofs of concept and not the best or most stable solutions, and works the best on desktop</strong>. Also, the most destinations are collected around my city.</p>

                <h3>Pixelite</h3>
                <p>A Commodore 64 & Commodore Plus/4 pixel editor made in HTML5/JS. The code itself is quite rough, as it was basically a playground for upgrading my JS/jQuery knowledge and learning about some of their quirks, but I really enjoyed working on it as some of the problems I face were puzzling and stimulating. I’m especially happy about the custom and really fast undo buffer feature and the all-in-all low memory consumption (which is one of the main factors I keep my eye on during the development).
                </p>
                <p>I plan to rewrite the project in TypeScript.</p>

                <p>Made about 10 years ago, but still very proud of it, as it was a really challenging and extremely complicated project. I’ve had to clone the features of the Sumatra PDF Reader to HTML4/CSS2/JS, while optimizing it for Internet Explorer 6 (Windows XP was still widely used those days).</p>
                <p>It’s numerous features included: PDF2web converter, asynchronous page loading, keyboard shortcuts, various view modes, search, bookmarking, and zoom.</p>
                <p>It included backend work as well (for the PDF conversions), but it mainly relied on old-school frontend work.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, since I don’t own the project, there’s only a video preview of it.</p>
